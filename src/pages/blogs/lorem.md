## Differnet Types of Blogs

I have constantly read about how writing a blog is one of the best ways to "level up" as a developer,
I've chosen to make a GatsyJS blog as I'd heard a lot about static websites

In these blogs I intend to

- Document the creation and decisions behind the maintenance of the Code Blog
- Summarize new coding techniques and concepts for easy retrieval
- Pracitce thinking about behavioral interview questions
- Eventually write my own tutorials to help others learn from my efforts

Rore nil sit scinditur et Typhoea tremenda pedis in iubete urbem? Hominumque
deum mirantur spoliare, per haut rediret caedis! Fides **iugo saepe dolor**,
paro; sustinet dixit Iovis, rore unda inpius enim.
